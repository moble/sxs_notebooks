# The `sxs` notebooks

This repository collects a few notebooks illustrating how to use the [`sxs` python
package](https://github.com/sxs-collaboration/sxs/).  The full documentation is found
[here](https://sxs.readthedocs.io/en/main/?badge=main).

Click the "binder" link above to run them in a live python session hosted on the web.  Once the
binder session opens, you'll probably want to proceed through the notebooks in numerical order.
Note that binder has a 2GB memory limit, so you'll have to shut down each notebook after you're done
with it by going to the "File" menu and clicking "Close and Halt".

Alternatively, you can install the `sxs` package on your own computer following the instructions
[here](https://sxs.readthedocs.io/en/main/?badge=main#installation), then download this repo, `cd`
into the directory of this repo, and open the notebooks with `jupyter notebook .`.

My presentation of this material in a workshop at Brown University's
[ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f20/) can be viewed
[here](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/?play=2351), or you can just view the presentation
slides on binder by opening "presentation.ipynb" and pressing the bar chart button.
